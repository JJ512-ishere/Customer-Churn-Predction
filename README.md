<p>A Customer Churn Prediction Model for an E-Commerce Website with noticeable class imbalance between Churn and Non-Churn in the dataset.
  Initially when using our CNN-LSTM model we only had an accuracy of about 84%.
  After using GAN(Generative Adversial Networks) on the dataset we were able to handle the class imbalance and when passed through our model we were able to achieve an accuracy of 97%.</p>
